# codeacademy

My class notes and tasks that I did during [Front-end +
Python](https://vigi.lt/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Frontend_Python.pdf)
course.

VIGI_46 group. Program started - 2022-07-12 -- ongoing.

# Why this format was chosen

I write all of my notes in `.org` files in Emacs. I navigate quick in
them, can collapse, expand the headers, add source blocks, move
information around, search for any word in a blink of a second and
most importantly for this blog, using `org-export-dispatch` - I can
export my .org note files into HTML.

I then apply a [css
sheet](https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes) and I have a
pretty DOCS style page!

I can then post it on Github pages so it can be used by me on other
machines(at work for example) or share it with others.

Enjoy, hope you find it useful or inspirational when learning
HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python, Databases or Flask!
